# PowerShell prompt
Colorful and git-enabled prompt for PowerShell

oh-my-posh was annoyingly slow and I just wanted a colorful prompt that stands out from output.

# Usage 
* In PowerShell type `notepad $PROFILE`
* On the first time it'll prompt you to create a new file, accept
* Paste in the contents of `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
* Save the file, restart PowerShell, enjoy.

I don't know what that makes the license. Public Domain? MIT? Who knows.
